  ## Project Description

  This is an open source project on GitHub, which generates a high-quality README.md file for the user. It includes what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

  To quickly and easily create a README file you can use the command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

  This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

  The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
